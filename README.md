#THE BLOC CLUB

## General Info

The Bloc Camp is a concert and music venue website showcasing featured upcoming shows, schedules, and artists' information. The site was built from scratch using the Flask framework and Python to assemble and stitch all the HTML files together. All event info, such as the artist's name, show's date, ticket price, and band images, was created using SQLite3 and populated from the database to multiple pages on the site, providing a smooth and consistent user experience. The site also allows users to subscribe to an email newsletter by storing the user's info and contact in the database, then notifying the page admin via email every time someone signs up for the newsletter. Also, CSS was heavily implemented to display a sleek, user-friendly, and straightforward design, which is very easy for users to navigate.
