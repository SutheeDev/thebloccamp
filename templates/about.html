    Live, local, and a little bit loud are the words the Bloc Camp lives by. A
    large space for standing and dancing to live music glows in rich ambient
    hues and a large full bar satiates as a diverse mix of local bands, dj's and
    headlining punk, alternative, rock, new wave, retro bands rock it. This is
    both a large and intimate venue that is open late and provides a great
    musical experience for the budget minded and the VIP crowd alike.
